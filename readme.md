# RÖCSSTI: to start CSS easily!

RÖCSSTI – pronounce "Roshti" – is my CSS starting base.

The name – absolutely ridiculous – is a friendly reference to KNACSS, a great CSS micro-framework CSS made by Raphaël Goetter, from which RÖCSSTI uses some elements, arranged by myself to answer to my work needs.

The goals are:

- Having a workflow (including order and naming convention);
- Having a structure that allows to go from global to particular;
- Thinking of a good CSS startbase, including accessibility elements, as skip links, to avoid forgetting them;
- Having a reusable class system (DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself);
- Having some nice and practical tips that enhance integration and use of a website;
 
To sum up, having a strong CSS base, used for and built from professional realisations.

RÖCSSTI has also a LESS version, see in "less" folder.

Information: In my actual job, RÖCSSTI has been used for about 14 websites, starting from simple ones to more complex responsive ones. The time gained at the beginning of the projects and the reusability of classes are perceptible.

## Naming conventions

- Indent: 2 spaces for properties
- No use of `!important`, that's bad!
- Use percents when it is possible
- Properties are written like this:

On a line (1 or 2 max): `p { margin: 0 0 1em; }`

On several lines:
```css
h1,
.h1 {
  font-size: 1.8571em;
  /* etc. */
}
```

- Use of low-case characters for hex values, e.g. `#efe`
- Use of compact notations, e.g. `margin: .5em;`
- No unit for null values, when it is allowed, e.g. `margin: 0;`
- CSS Properties are displayed in alphabetical order, when it is possible.
